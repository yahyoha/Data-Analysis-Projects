# Advanced Data Analysis

This is my implementation for the first project I did as part of udacity Nanodegree for "Advanced data analysis".

This is the first project out of 3 main projects which focuses on:

* Item 1 Investigating a data set: In this project, I have used Pandas and NumPy in exploring a data set for movies, walking through the entire data analysis process (posing questions, Dta wrangling, Explore, Draw conclusions and communicate).
