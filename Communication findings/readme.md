# (Dataset Exploration for Ford GoBike System Data)
## by (Ahmed Othman)


## Dataset

> The dataset that I have used is "201902-fordgobike-tripdata" which contains info about the user base such as gender, age, duration of bike usage, subscription type, and locations where users pickup bikes and returned them.

## Summary of Findings
- The majority of users for the biking service are subscribers (almost 160K users are subscribers), while less than 20K are just customers.
- By looking at the gender distribution we can clearly see that males represent 75% of users.
- Most of the users who used the bikes for longer periods of time (i.e. over 15000 s) were born after 1980.
- men tended to subscribe more for the service than women.
- Lastly, younger males in their twenties use bikes for the longest, then in mid twenties.
